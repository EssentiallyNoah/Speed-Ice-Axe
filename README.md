# Speed-Ice-Axe
Given the increasing popularity of ice climbing and the relatively low variety of speed ice climbing tools, I decided to try and design my own version with the goal of minimizing weight while maximizing reach and stiffness.

The model has increased the reach by about 2 inches beyond what is currently available on the market while keeping the weight at an ultralight 8.1 ounces per pick.

It uses A2 tool steel for the pick and 6061 aluminum for the handle. The bolts used to attach the pick to the handle are M5 12mm stainless steel Torx screws. The handle uses a loop of crimped 2mm steel cable as additional support.

NOTE: In its current state, the design has been run through multiple simulations but has not yet been field tested.
